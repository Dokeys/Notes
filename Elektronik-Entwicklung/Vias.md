# Vias

- Small drill size (e.g. 0.15mm) -> Increased cost, lower yield.
- Small annular ring (e.g. 0.1mm) -> Increased cost, lower yield.

## Recommended 'general purpose' vias

- Large:    Pad=0.7mm    Drill=0.3mm
- Medium:    Pad=0.6mm    Drill=0.25mm
- Small:    Pad=0.5mm    Drill=0.2mm

## Rule of thumb

- 1x Via -> 1.5 Amps (regardless of size)

- For high-current use Parallel vias
